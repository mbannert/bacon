## What is git?

- git is a piece of software that runs on your computer
- git is a *decentralized* version control system
- state-of-the-art tool for controlling versions and collaboration among developers
- [github](https://github.com/), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) and [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) are popular providers (free remote repos)

## How does it work?

## What do I need to remember?

- git clone
- git add (staging)
- git commit -m 'What did we change in the new version'
- git push
- git pull
- git status


- git log
- git checkout 
- git branch
- git remote -v

## Why use git (in academia) ?

- empirical researchers need to be more data savy than ever before, programming and reproducibility are highly demanded
- version control has been part of professional software development collaborations for decades, more and more fields use it to collaborate 
- git is the state-of-the-art for modern version control

## Let's try the following

1.) Form 2 groups

2.) Every group member needs a github account

3.) assign one leader per group

4.) leader creates a new repository

5.) all members clone this repository

6.) add a function to a folder called R and commit
